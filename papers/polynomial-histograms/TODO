1. Copy the latest sources into this directory.
(Mostly done. Some rename. I created a figures/ directory, need to make
sure tex runs with that.)

2. Find a venue to
submit it to.  Murray prefers either an applied statistics journal of
some kind, or a very quantitative computer science systems conference
(like SIGMETRICS, but the work isn't yet strong enough for SIGMETRICS).

3. Submit Tim's latest proofs.

4. Implement the R code for higher order moment EMDCC plots and calculations.
